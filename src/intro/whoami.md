# Who am I?

I am a computer sience student that does software development in his free time. I like open formats, and rclone makes accessing different protocols as easy as it gets. With Round Sync i am trying to make rclone as accessible as possible on android. Since i forked rcx, i was able to make substantial progress of achieving this goal.

Since i am doing this in my free time, any help is appreciated. This can be in form of contributions(Like reporting bugs or contributing code), but if you want to make a donation, you are more than welcome!
